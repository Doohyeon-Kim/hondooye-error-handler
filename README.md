# hondooye_error_handler

## Project Ownership & Package Migration

This package was originally developed and maintained by **Doohyeon Kim** under the name `hondooye_error_handler`.  
On January 5, 2026, all `hondooye_*` packages, including this one, were officially migrated and are now professionally developed and maintained by **XERKONIX Inc.** as part of the `xerkonix_*` family of libraries.

The actively maintained successor to this package is:

- Package: `xerkonix_error_handler`
- Pub.dev: [xerkonix_error_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/xerkonix_error_handler)

This project remains open source, but new features, improvements, and long-term support are provided in the XERKONIX-managed package.  
For new projects, it is strongly recommended to use `xerkonix_error_handler` instead of `hondooye_error_handler`.
